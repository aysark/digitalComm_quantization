## Random Signal Transformations & Quantization


**Introduction**

By transforming random variables with uniform distributions we are able to generate samples for various probability density functions, such as those of exponential distribution. In this lab, we implemented a uniform quantizer that is used in the pulse code modulation system to digitally represent sampled analog signals. We also explored nonuniform quantization using nonlinear systems.
